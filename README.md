# Block-9-personal-website

Welcome to my personal website repository! This project serves as my first attempt into creating my own website, where I aim to showcase my skills, experiences, and interests to the world.

# Overview
Creating a personal website is an exciting journey where I get to express my creativity and build something that represents who I am. This project will include various elements such as an introduction, an about me section, and a portfolio showcasing my work.

# Technologies Used
To bring my personal website to life, I'll be using the following technologies:

HTML: For structuring the content of the website.

CSS: For styling and designing the layout.

JavaScript: For adding interactivity and dynamic features.

GitHub: For hosting the website and making it easy to access online.
